/**
 * Triggered by the Geofence.  Since we can have many Geofences at once, we pull the request
 * ID from the first Geofence, and locate it within the cached data in our Room DB
 *
 * Or users can add the reminders and then close the app, So our app has to run in the background
 * and handle the geofencing in the background.
 * To do that you can use https://developer.android.com/reference/android/support/v4/app/JobIntentService to do that.
 *
 * Note: The broadcast receiver is how Android apps can send or receive broadcast messages from the Android system and other Android apps.
